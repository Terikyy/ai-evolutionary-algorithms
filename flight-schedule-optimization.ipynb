    "# Evolutionary Algorithms - Flight Schedule Optimization\n",
    "\n",
    "## Task Description\n",
    "An airline operates a fleet of 8 aircraft with varying capacities and operating costs. Each aircraft has a designated home airport.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Objective\n",
    "Develop an evolutionary algorithm that maximizes profit by optimally assigning 30 scheduled flights to the aircraft fleet.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Problem Constraints\n",
    "- All flights must be executed - no cancellations allowed, even if unprofitable \n",
    "- Capacity limits: Aircraft cannot exceed their seat capacity \n",
    "- Scheduled departure: Flights cannot depart early but may depart late \n",
    "- Ground time: 40 minutes required between consecutive flights for refueling and service \n",
    "- No flight merging: Each flight operates independently\n",
    "\n",
    "### Profit Calculation\n",
    "**Revenue:** Ticket price per passenger × number of passengers \n",
    "\n",
    "**Costs:**\n",
    "- Operating costs (per flight hour, varies by aircraft) \n",
    "- Delay penalty: €10 per minute for late departures (per flight) \n",
    "- Empty positioning flights (if needed to relocate aircraft) \n",
    "\n",
    "### Implementation Requirements\n",
    "1. Design a suitable genome representation for flight-to-aircraft assignments \n",
    "2. Implement crossover and mutation operators \n",
    "3. Create a fitness evaluation function that calculates total profit \n",
    "4. Apply the algorithm to the provided dataset (8 planes, 30 flights, 8 airports)"
